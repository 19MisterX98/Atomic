# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The latest version will always be supported. If you use an older version of the client and did not update in a while, we will not be able to help you.

Try to replicate the issue with a later version of the client, if you found a bug.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| latest  | :white_check_mark: |
| <latest | :x:                |

## Reporting a bug

If you found a bug, open a new issue and tell us about it. If the issue is with a later version of the client, update the client and try to replicate again. If you use other mods that affect critical parts of the gameplay (such as other clients or mods with a lot of content), try to replicate the issue with only the client and nothing more.
