## Why?
This is the sequel to [cornos](https://cornos.cf), but ported to 1.17, with a new look and functionality. Cornos became a bit stale, so I decided to start this.

## Downloading
You can download this from the `builds` folder. The latest jarfile will always be called "latest.jar". Download and drag into your 1.17+ mods folder to use.
Download in the `builds` folder, or [here](https://github.com/cornos/Atomic/raw/master/builds/latest.jar) for a direct download link

## Installing
Installing this is a bit tricky on any OS except windows.

### Linux
1. Download java 16
2. Extract java 16 to a folder of your choice
3. Tell your 1.17 minecraft instance to use that java 16, if it doesn't automatically do it
4. Get fabric for 1.17
5. Drag the .jar into the `mods` folder, no libraries required
6. Start the game

### Windows
The default launcher should already choose java 16 for the runtime, so you're free from steps 1-3
1. Get fabric for 1.17
2. Drag the .jar into the `mods` folder, no libraries required
3. Start the game

### Mac
I have no idea how mac works, but I guess it's going to be similar to linux
