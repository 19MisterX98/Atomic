# Atomic client

## WARNING
This is under heavy development, and not yet ready to use.

## Why?
This is the sequel to [cornos](https://cornos.cf), but ported to 1.17, with a new look and functionality. Cornos became a bit stale, so I decided to start this.

## Downloading
While you **can** download the client and use it, I don't recommend doing that for now. The client is under heavy development and far from being complete. If you do want to use it for whatever reason, a prebuilt jarfile will always be [here](https://github.com/cornos/Atomic/raw/master/builds/latest.jar)

## Installing
Installing this mod is a bit tricky, but you'll do it. First, you need java 16 to run this mod. On linux, you can just download the .tar and put it somewhere, then use that java path as java installation in the minecraft launcher. On Windows, you can do basically the same thing, but you have to be careful to not accidentally overwrite your current installation.
