# Atomic client
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80022388/121610880-4bf14280-ca57-11eb-97ff-1c94461533ae.png)
## WARNING
This is under heavy development, and not yet ready to use.

## Why?
This is the sequel to [cornos](https://cornos.cf), but ported to 1.17, with a new look and functionality. Cornos became a bit stale, so I decided to start this.

## Downloading
The client is not yet ready to use

You have to build to client for yourself for now, if you really want to experience it. I expect you to know how gradle works. Since this is for 1.17, you need to use java 16 and gradle 7.0.2
